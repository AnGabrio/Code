# Code
A selection of some R, BUGS and STAN code used in my research

To have a look at my works, papers or whatever, and have a better idea on how to use this code, please refer to:

If interested in more details about some of these projects, or would like to have a nice chat on these topics, 
please feel free to contact me as I would be happy to discuss them with you.
